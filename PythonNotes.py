# Notes from Basics
# Python Basics
String Rules in Python:
# 1. Strings are immutable.(Example: you cannot change a character in a string directly)
# 2. Strings can be concatenated using the + operator.
# 3. Strings can be repeated using the * operator.
# 4. Strings can be indexed and sliced.
# 5. Strings can be formatted using f-strings, format() method, or % operator.
# 6. Strings can be iterated over using loops.
# Indexing in Python:
# 0-based indexing is used in Python, meaning the first character is at index 0
# 7. Strings can be checked for membership using the in operator.
# 8. Strings can be converted to uppercase or lowercase using upper() and lower() methods.
# 9. Strings can be stripped of whitespace using strip() method.(# Example: '  Hello  '.strip() results in 'Hello')
# 10. Strings can be split into a list using split() method. (Example: 'Hello World'.split() results in ['Hello', 'World'])
# 11. Strings can be joined using join() method. (Example: ' '.join(['Hello', 'World']) results in 'Hello World')
# 12. Strings can be checked for palindromes by comparing the string to its reverse. (Example: 'racecar' == 'racecar'[::-1]
# 13. Strings can be checked for anagrams by sorting the characters and comparing. (Example: sorted('listen') == sorted('silent')
# 14. Strings can be checked for substrings using the in operator. (Example: 'Hello' in 'Hello World' returns True
# 15. Strings can be checked for prefixes and suffixes using startswith() and endswith() methods.
